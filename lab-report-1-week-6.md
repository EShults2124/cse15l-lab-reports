Copy whole directories with scp -r:

* Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6 account

* Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository

* Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.

## Things To Do

Choose one of the Group Choice Options (1-3) from week 5. Complete it for yourself (if you havenâ€™t already), and take the relevant screenshots listed below for your choice. Create a post with a few sentences of description about each. Do this for only one of these options for your lab report.
